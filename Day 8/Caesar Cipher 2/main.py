# TODO-1:
# Create a function called decrypt() that takes original_text and shift_amount as 2 inputs.
#
# TODO-2:
# Inside the decrypt() function, shift each letter of the original_text forwards in the alphabet backwards by the shift_amount and print the decrypted text.
#
#  Hint 1
# TODO-3:
# Combine the encrypt() and decrypt() functions into a single function called caesar().
# Use the value of the user chosen direction variable to determine which functionality to use.
# call the caesar function instead of encrypt/decrypt and pass in all three variables direction/text/shift.
#  Hint 2
